# React.js with Next.js Template

This template is created for projects built with React.js using Next.js. The repository is configured with ESLint and Prettier for developing applications in VS Code. Additionally, settings are included for automating the code formatting process during commits.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the command `npm i` in the terminal.
3. Add your custom keybinding for formatting documents in VSCode.

### Adding a Keybinding in VSCode

3.1. Open the command menu (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), and type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)".

3.2. Add the following keybinding for formatting the document:

<pre>
<code>
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+f",
    "command": "editor.action.formatDocument",
    "when": "editorHasDocumentFormattingProvider && editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
  }
]
</code>
</pre>

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
